# Global Ontology Engine

## Main Goal
The main goal of this project is to create an AI-powered "Global Ontology Engine" that acts as a real-time entity extraction and intelligence mapping tool. It takes raw text inputs (like news articles or intelligence briefs), uses a Large Language Model (Google Gemini via `google-genai`) to extract a dynamic knowledge graph (entities/nodes and their relationships/edges), and stores this graph in a Neo4j graph database. The frontend provides a Next.js-based interactive visualization of this knowledge graph using `react-force-graph-2d` and allows users to request an AI-generated analyst brief based on the extracted situational context.

## What is Done and Capabilities
- **Backend API**: A FastAPI server that exposes two main endpoints:
  - `POST /api/extract`: Receives raw text, calls the Gemini LLM to extract nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), and saves the resulting graph into a Neo4j AuraDB graph database using Cypher queries.
  - `POST /api/insights`: Receives a topic and graph context, and uses the Gemini LLM to generate a concise analyst brief summarizing the situation and outlining key risks.
- **LLM Integration**: Uses the `google-genai` SDK with fallback models (`gemini-2.5-flash`, etc.) and structured JSON output generation via Pydantic schemas to ensure accurate and reliable graph extraction.
- **Database Connection**: Seamlessly connects to Neo4j with a singleton driver instance to run queries securely.
- **Ingestion Script**: A standalone `ingest.py` script to bulk-process articles from `sample_data.json` with rate-limiting baked in.
- **Frontend App**: A Next.js application built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS (`lucide-react` for icons).
- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Uses `react-force-graph-2d` (rendered via Canvas/D3.js) to dynamically display the knowledge graph. Nodes are color-coded dynamically based on their category labels.
- **Graph Physics Controls**: Custom sliders allow the user to tweak D3 force-directed physics (repulsion and link distance) in real-time.

## Directory and File Details

### `/ (Root Folder)`
The main workspace containing both backend and frontend codebases, top-level documentation, and dependencies.
- `prompt.md`: This file, detailing the project overview, structure, capabilities, and file descriptions, with the original prompt appended at the end.
- `README.md`: The root documentation file outlining the entire project and linking to frontend and backend specific READMEs.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains the Python dependencies required for the backend (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `neo4j`, `google-genai`, `pydantic`, `python-dotenv`).

### `/Backend/`
Contains the Python FastAPI backend application that handles data extraction, database interaction, and AI brief generation.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore for Git.
- `README.md`: Backend specific documentation and setup/run instructions.
- `database.py`: Handles the Neo4j database connection using the official neo4j driver. Provides a global database driver and includes the `insert_graph_data` function to merge nodes and relationships using Cypher queries.
- `ingest.py`: A standalone utility script to load JSON data from `sample_data.json` and bulk ingest it through the LLM extraction pipeline and into the Neo4j database, complete with rate-limiting pauses.
- `llm.py`: Manages the Google Gemini API integration using the `google-genai` library. Defines Pydantic schemas (`Node`, `Edge`, `KnowledgeGraphSchema`) to enforce structured JSON output. Contains `extract_graph_from_text` to parse text into a graph and `generate_analyst_brief` for situation reports.
- `main.py`: The entry point for the FastAPI application. Sets up CORS middleware, global logging, and defines the RESTful endpoints (`/api/extract` and `/api/insights`) that wire together the LLM and DB logic.
- `sample_data.json`: A sample dataset (JSON array of text objects) used by `ingest.py` for testing bulk ingestions.

### `/Frontend/`
Contains the frontend project.
- `README.md`: Documentation holding information about the frontend and how to set it up and run it.

### `/Frontend/ai-onto-globe/`
Contains the Next.js React frontend application.
- `.gitignore`: Next.js specific git ignore rules.
- `AGENTS.md` & `CLAUDE.md` & `README.md`: Markdown files for agent/human instructions and project documentation.
- `eslint.config.mjs`: Configuration file for ESLint linting.
- `jsconfig.json`: JavaScript configuration for the Next.js project, setting up compiler options and path aliases.
- `next.config.mjs`: Next.js build and runtime configuration.
- `package.json` & `package-lock.json`: Defines npm dependencies (like `react`, `next`, `axios`, `react-force-graph-2d`, `tailwindcss`) and scripts (`dev`, `build`, etc.).
- `postcss.config.mjs`: PostCSS configuration for processing Tailwind CSS.

#### `/Frontend/ai-onto-globe/app/`
The Next.js App Router directory.
- `favicon.ico`: The application's favicon.
- `globals.css`: Global CSS file, notably integrating Tailwind CSS styles.
- `layout.js`: The root layout wrapper for the Next.js application, defining HTML structure and global metadata.
- `page.js`: The main dashboard page component. Handles state for input text, extracted graph data, the AI brief, and physics slider values. Manages API calls via the `lib/api.js` layer and orchestrates the child components.

#### `/Frontend/ai-onto-globe/components/`
Reusable React components.
- `CustomSlider.js`: A specialized slider input component used to control D3 graph physics parameters (like repulsion and link distance).
- `KnowledgeGraph.js`: The core visualization component. It dynamically imports `react-force-graph-2d` (to avoid SSR issues), maps node labels to dynamic colors, and hooks the React state into the D3 simulation engine to update forces (repulsion and link distance) in real-time.

#### `/Frontend/ai-onto-globe/lib/`
Utility libraries and API client wrappers.
- `api.js`: Wraps Axios to make API calls to the backend (`/api/extract` and `/api/insights`). Configured to use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable or fallback to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

#### `/Frontend/ai-onto-globe/public/`
Static assets served directly by Next.js.
- `file.svg`, `globe.svg`, `next.svg`, `vercel.svg`, `window.svg`: Various SVG icons and logos used within the project (standard Next.js boilerplate).
